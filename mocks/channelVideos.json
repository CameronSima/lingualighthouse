It's time to stop looking down and start looking UP,  to take in the beautiful sights!  At least, for this video.  And this time around, we can get even more clear video footage thanks to the new Xbox rerelease version of the game!  I also share some speedrun stories, gaming analysis, and some folklore on the one and only \"OGAR\" strategy which has landed somewhere between meme and ancient legend when it comes to playing GoldenEye's Archives stage...\n\nI've been influenced by other Nintendo 64 channels lately, exploring the wonderful worlds of N64 games and retro gaming, and so I want to make this video.  I hope you enjoy my analysis and commentary, exploring these strange areas of a game I've spent so much time speedrunning over the years.\n\n\n00:00 Intro\n01:40 Manscaped #ad \n03:23 Dam Basement\n09:18 Runway Mirages\n17:35 Caverns Bridge\n22:22 Archives OGAR\n28:47 The Knolly Bush\n31:59 So Long, King GE007!\n\n--\n\nMusic used in my videos is made and produced specifically for this channel by Carathorn: https://www.youtube.com/user/Carathorn\n\n--\n\nPlease consider supporting SpeedLore on Patreon! https://patreon.com/speedlore\n\n➤ SUPPORT ➤ PATREON ➤ https://patreon.com/speedlore\n➤ WATCH ➤ TWITCH ➤ http://twitch.tv/rwhitegoose\n➤ FOLLOW ➤ TWITTER ➤ http://twitter.com/rwhitegoose\n\nFeel free to contact me for any purpose; business, video ideas, any questions are welcome!\n\nThanks for watching, and until next time, stay true!",

Aztec 00 Agent has long been considered the most difficult stage in all of GoldenEye 007 for the Nintendo 64.  However, this also can mean that the speedrun world record on the stage is less optimized than other stages, due to its difficulty.  This might just give an opening wide enough for a savvy, veteran speedrunner to maneuver his way in there with some clever strategies, to achieve an untied world record!

        "description": "This is truly the most ridiculous strategy ever discovered in GoldenEye 007 speedrunning...\n\nA number of lads, helmed by speedrunning mad scientist Whiteted recently released a number of new speedruns and tool-assisted speedruns in an \"unhoard\" video project called \"TASpap\".  Among many remarkable videos and discoveries, was this new \"piggyback strategy\", perhaps the absolutely most insane and bizarre speedrun strategy ever found.  Enjoy this video full of speedrun analysis, gaming history, and retro Nintendo 64 commentary, sharing remarkable stories from the games' long history.\n\nWill anyone ever pull this off?  Which new untied world records will be performed with this rare technique?
